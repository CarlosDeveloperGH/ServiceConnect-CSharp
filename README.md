## Project Maturity
R.MessageBus is used by a number of high-profile financial applications in production environments. However,  it is still in early stages of development and hasnâ€™t been officially released.  It may not yet be suitable for the most demanding and conservative projects. Production-ready release is planned for the end of March 2015

Public API is relatively stable and no major changes are planned in the next version.


## Getting Started

In order to get started, have a look at the documentation at [http://rmessagebus.com/guides](http://rmessagebus.com/guides)

### Configuration

#### Simple Configuration

Calling initialize with no parameters will create an instance of the Bus with default configuration options.

```c#
IBus bus = Bus.Initialize();
```

Default configuration is the following,

* Consumer - RabbitMQ
* Container - StructureMap
* ScanForMessageHandlers - False

#### Custom Configuration

Initialize also takes a single lambda/action parameter for custom configuration.

```c#
IBus bus = Bus.Initialize(config =>
{
    config.LoadSettings("MyConfigurationPath", "MyEndpoint");
    config.SetConsumer<Consumer>();
    config.SetPublisher<Publisher>();
    config.SetContainer<Container>();
    config.ScanForMesssageHandlers = true;
});
```
